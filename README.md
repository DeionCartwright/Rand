Rand RestfulAPI demo

The API made use of postman in order to make requests to the database. A link to my postman workspace is available in the email provided.

I used MySQL for the database.

Regarding Requirement 3:

Unfortunately I wasn't able to complete requirement 3 within the time frame, an error occurs where postman can't find the path when the request is made. I am still unsure why this is the case. I'll continue looking into it afterwards, however it would be appreciated if you could help explain where I went wrong.
